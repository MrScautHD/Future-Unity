Pull Requests
=============

Stellution is an open source project and Pull Requests from any competent coder are extremely welcome - we could use the help!

Pull Requests meeting the following guidelines can be merged:

1. Please make one sensibly-named commit, which describes the aspect you are fixing.

2. One Pull Request per commit please. It confuses us if you mix three unrelated commits in one Pull Request.

3. If you're fixing something which is not already in the issues list and is not obvious, please make comments explaining what you fixed.

4. Please respect our code style. You can see the style by looking at existing sources.

Pull Requests not meeting these guidelines are also welcomed, but we may have to manually merge them, which means that you may not be automatically accredited as the author in the changelog....

All Pull Requests automatically become subject to Stellution's licence. If you're interested in the legal stuff, it's here: https://github.com/MrScautHD/Stellution/blob/Game/LICENSE.txt
